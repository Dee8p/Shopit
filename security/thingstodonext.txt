MAIN LANDING PAGE
we can implement changes in the main landing page:
- get most of the user info, for the basics first get the name of the user when they log on to the page.

SET THE LIMITS OF SUCTOMER AND SELLER USER SETTINGS:
- next i beleive there are some changes in oreder as to what kind of users should be there:
    1) customer, can come here as the guest also but cannot do anything beyond the adding to the cart point 
    2) seller, now sellers should have the access to 
        a) sell any products
        b) see how many of the products are selling
    3) also one cannot have the same customer and seller

OTHER FRONT END THINGS

- make the website pretty.  

COUNTER OF THE CARTS REMOVING FOR THE CUSTOMER:
- make the changes for the last time when removes the product from the cart and the counter in the products/ main landing page should go up.

SOME HARD THINGS:
